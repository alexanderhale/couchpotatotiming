# Couch Potato Investment Timing

Index investing is a type of "passive" investing, where the investor buys and holds stocks that attempt to match the performance of a broad section of the stock market. This approach has historically shown to yield a good return on investment with minimal effort and minimal fees. The increased access for individuals to invest (as opposed to buying through a bank or brokerage), as well as sources like the [Canadian Couch Potato blog](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/), have popularized this investing strategy.

The Couch Potato strategy involves buying shares of [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) in a [dollar-cost averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) strategy - that is, investing the same amount of money at regular intervals. Dollar-cost averaging "smooths" out the regular fluctuations of the stock market, and lends itself to automation. Making investments automatically can be an advantage to some people, because it reduces the temptation to buy or sell shares in a panic when prices dip or spike.

When automizing investments - for example, buying shares once per week - what is the best time of day, or best day of the week, to buy in? The data analysis in this repository aims to find out.
